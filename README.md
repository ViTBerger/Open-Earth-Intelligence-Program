## Research Thrusts / Strategic Vectors
### Vector 1: Advanced Model Architectures
*   **Objective:** To pioneer and implement next-generation foundation model architectures that are fundamentally more scalable, efficient, and expressive. Our research in this vector focuses on moving beyond monolithic transformer designs to explore more dynamic and powerful paradigms.
*   **Key Explorations & Projects:**
    *   **Scalable Architectures:** Investigating and implementing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to dramatically increase model parameter counts while maintaining manageable computational costs.
    *   **Novel Generative Frameworks:** Adapting and advancing diffusion-based models for complex geospatial data generation and representation learning, inspired by recent successes in language and vision domains.

    *   **Code:** [Link to Repo A], [Link to Repo B]
### Vector 2: Heterogeneous Geospatial Modality Fusion
*   **Objective:** To create a unified and coherent representation space that seamlessly fuses the full spectrum of geospatial data. This vector tackles the unique challenge of remote sensing data's heterogeneity, unlocking insights that are invisible to any single modality.
*   **Key Explorations & Projects:**
    *   **Beyond Vision-Language:** Moving past standard RGB and text to deeply integrate remote sensing-specific modalities, including Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Multispectral/Hyperspectral imagery, and elevation data.
    *   **Cross-Modal Alignment:** Designing novel alignment techniques and fusion layers that respect the distinct physical properties and statistical distributions of each data source.

    *   **Code:** [Link to Repo C]
### Vector 3: Enhanced Cognitive & Inferential Reasoning
*   **Objective:** To elevate the model's capabilities from basic perception to complex cognitive reasoning. This vector aims to enable the model to function less like a tool and more like an expert analyst, capable of understanding intent and executing multi-step analytical tasks.
*   **Key Explorations & Projects:**
    *   **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Developing frameworks that allow the model to break down complex user queries (e.g., "Find all areas with recent deforestation that are also at high risk for landslides") into a logical chain of operations.
    *   **Interpretable Spatial-Temporal Analysis:** Enabling the model to not just identify patterns but to articulate the "why" behind them, explaining complex spatial-temporal relationships in a human-understandable format.
