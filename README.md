# Open-Earth Intelligence Program: A Collection of Research Projects towards Remote Sensing Foundation Models 

## Program Vision

## Research Thrusts / Strategic Vectors
### Vector 1: Advanced Model Architectures
### Vector 2: Heterogeneous Geospatial Modality Fusion
### Vector 3: Enhanced Cognitive & Inferential Reasoning
*   **Objective:** To elevate the model's capabilities from basic perception to complex cognitive reasoning. This vector aims to enable the model to function less like a tool and more like an expert analyst, capable of understanding intent and executing multi-step analytical tasks.
*   **Key Explorations & Projects:**
    *   **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Developing frameworks that allow the model to break down complex user queries (e.g., "Find all areas with recent deforestation that are also at high risk for landslides") into a logical chain of operations.
    *   **Interpretable Spatial-Temporal Analysis:** Enabling the model to not just identify patterns but to articulate the "why" behind them, explaining complex spatial-temporal relationships in a human-understandable format.
